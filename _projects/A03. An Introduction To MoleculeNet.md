One of the most powerful features of DeepChem is that it comes "batteries included" with datasets to use. The DeepChem developer community maintains the MoleculeNet [1] suite of datasets which maintains a large collection of different scientific datasets for use in machine learning applications. The original MoleculeNet suite had 17 datasets mostly focused on molecular properties. Over the last several years, MoleculeNet has evolved into a broader collection of scientific datasets to facilitate the broad use and development of scientific machine learning tools.

These datasets are integrated with the rest of the DeepChem suite so you can conveniently access these through functions in the `dc.molnet` submodule. You've already seen a few examples of these loaders already as you've worked through the tutorial series. The full documentation for the MoleculeNet suite is available in our docs [2].

## Setup

To run DeepChem within Colab, you'll need to run the following installation commands. You can of course run this tutorial locally if you prefer. In that case, don't run these cells since they will download and install DeepChem again on your local machine.

---

```python
!pip install --pre deepchem
```

---

We can now import the `deepchem` package to play with.

---

```python
import deepchem as dc
dc.__version__
```

'2.4.0-rc1.dev'

---

# MoleculeNet Overview

In the last two tutorials we loaded the Delaney dataset of molecular solubilities.  Let's load it one more time.

---

```python
tasks, datasets, transformers = dc.molnet.load_delaney(featurizer='GraphConv', splitter='random')
```

---

Notice that the loader function we invoke `dc.molnet.load_delaney` lives in the `dc.molnet` submodule of MoleculeNet loaders. Let's take a look at the full collection of loaders available for us

---

```python
[method for method in dir(dc.molnet) if "load_" in method ]
```

['load_bace_classification',
 'load_bace_regression',
 'load_bandgap',
 'load_bbbc001',
 'load_bbbc002',
 'load_bbbp',
 'load_cell_counting',

 'load_tox21',
 'load_toxcast',
 'load_uspto',
 'load_uv',
 'load_zinc15']

The set of MoleculeNet loaders is actively maintained by the DeepChem community and we work on adding new datasets to the collection. Let's see how many datasets there are in MoleculeNet today

---

```python
len([method for method in dir(dc.molnet) if "load_" in method ])
```

# MoleculeNet Dataset Categories

There's a lot of different datasets in MoleculeNet. Let's do a quick overview of the different types of datasets available. We'll break datasets into different categories and list loaders which belong to those categories. More details on each of these datasets can be found at https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moleculenet.html. The original MoleculeNet paper [1] provides details about a subset of these papers. We've marked these datasets as "V1" below. All remaining dataset are "V2" and not documented in the older paper.

# MoleculeNet Loaders Explained

All MoleculeNet loader functions take the form `dc.molnet.load_X`. Loader functions return a tuple of arguments `(tasks, datasets, transformers)`. Let's walk through each of these return values and explain what we get:

1. `tasks`: This is a list of task-names. Many datasets in MoleculeNet are "multitask". That is, a given datapoint has multiple labels associated with it. These correspond to different measurements or values associated with this datapoint.
2. `datasets`: This field is a tuple of three `dc.data.Dataset` objects `(train, valid, test)`. These correspond to the training, validation, and test set for this MoleculeNet dataset.
3. `transformers`: This field is a list of `dc.trans.Transformer` objects which were applied to this dataset during processing.

This is abstract so let's take a look at each of these fields for the `dc.molnet.load_delaney` function we invoked above. Let's start with `tasks`.

---

```python
tasks
```

---

['measured log solubility in mols per litre']

We have one task in this dataset which corresponds to the measured log solubility in mol/L. Let's now take a look at `datasets`:

---

```python
datasets
```

---

(<DiskDataset X.shape: (902,), y.shape: (902, 1), w.shape: (902, 1), ids: ['CCC(C)Cl' 'O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C' 'Oc1ccccn1' ...
  'CCCCCCCC(=O)OCC' 'O=Cc1ccccc1' 'CCCC=C(CC)C=O'], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>,
 <DiskDataset X.shape: (113,), y.shape: (113, 1), w.shape: (113, 1), ids: ['CSc1nc(nc(n1)N(C)C)N(C)C' 'CC#N' 'CCCCCCCC#C' ... 'ClCCBr'
  'CCN(CC)C(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)nn1' 'CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C '], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>,
 <DiskDataset X.shape: (113,), y.shape: (113, 1), w.shape: (113, 1), ids: ['CCCCc1c(C)nc(nc1O)N(C)C '
  'Cc3cc2nc1c(=O)[nH]c(=O)nc1n(CC(O)C(O)C(O)CO)c2cc3C'
  'CSc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1' ... 'O=c1[nH]cnc2[nH]ncc12 '
  'CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1' 'OC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2'], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>)

---

As we mentioned previously, we see that `datasets` is a tuple of 3 datasets. Let's split them out.

---

```python
train, valid, test = datasets
```

---

```python
train
```

---

<DiskDataset X.shape: (902,), y.shape: (902, 1), w.shape: (902, 1), ids: ['CCC(C)Cl' 'O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C' 'Oc1ccccn1' ...
 'CCCCCCCC(=O)OCC' 'O=Cc1ccccc1' 'CCCC=C(CC)C=O'], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>

---

```python
valid
```

---

<DiskDataset X.shape: (113,), y.shape: (113, 1), w.shape: (113, 1), ids: ['CSc1nc(nc(n1)N(C)C)N(C)C' 'CC#N' 'CCCCCCCC#C' ... 'ClCCBr'
 'CCN(CC)C(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)nn1' 'CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C '], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>

---

```python
test
```

---

<DiskDataset X.shape: (113,), y.shape: (113, 1), w.shape: (113, 1), ids: ['CCCCc1c(C)nc(nc1O)N(C)C '
 'Cc3cc2nc1c(=O)[nH]c(=O)nc1n(CC(O)C(O)C(O)CO)c2cc3C'
 'CSc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1' ... 'O=c1[nH]cnc2[nH]ncc12 '
 'CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1' 'OC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2'], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>

---

Let's peek into one of the datapoints in the `train` dataset.

---

```python
train.X[0]
```

---

<deepchem.feat.mol_graphs.ConvMol at 0x7fe1ef601438>

---

Note that this is a `dc.feat.mol_graphs.ConvMol` object produced by `dc.feat.ConvMolFeaturizer`. We'll say more about how to control choice of featurization shortly. Finally let's take a look at the `transformers` field:

---

```python
transformers
```

---

So we see that one transformer was applied, the `dc.trans.NormalizationTransformer`.

After reading through this description so far, you may be wondering what choices are made under the hood. As we've briefly mentioned previously, datasets can be processed with different choices of "featurizers". Can we control the choice of featurization here? In addition, how was the source dataset split into train/valid/test as three different datasets?

You can use the 'featurizer' and 'splitter' keyword arguments and pass in different strings. Common possible choices for 'featurizer' are 'ECFP', 'GraphConv', 'Weave' and 'smiles2img' corresponding to the `dc.feat.CircularFingerprint`, `dc.feat.ConvMolFeaturizer`, `dc.feat.WeaveFeaturizer` and `dc.feat.SmilesToImage` featurizers. Common possible choices for 'splitter' are `None`, 'index', 'random', 'scaffold' and 'stratified' corresponding to no split, `dc.splits.IndexSplitter`, `dc.splits.RandomSplitter`, `dc.splits.SingletaskStratifiedSplitter`. We haven't talked much about splitters yet, but intuitively they're a way to partition a dataset based on different criteria. We'll say more in a future tutorial.

Instead of a string, you also can pass in any `Featurizer` or `Splitter` object.  This is very useful when, for example, a Featurizer has constructor arguments you can use to customize its behavior.

---

```python
tasks, datasets, transformers = dc.molnet.load_delaney(featurizer="ECFP", splitter="scaffold")
```

---

```python
(train, valid, test) = datasets
```

---

```python
train
```

<DiskDataset X.shape: (902, 1024), y.shape: (902, 1), w.shape: (902, 1), ids: ['CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O)' 'CCCC=C' 'CCCCCCCCCCCCCC' ...
 'Nc2cccc3nc1ccccc1cc23 ' 'C1CCCCCC1' 'OC1CCCCCC1'], task_names: ['measured log solubility in mols per litre']>

---

```python
train.X[0]
```

---

array([0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.])

---

Note that unlike the earlier invocation we have numpy arrays produced by `dc.feat.CircularFingerprint` instead of `ConvMol` objects produced by `dc.feat.ConvMolFeaturizer`.

Give it a try for yourself. Try invoking MoleculeNet to load some other datasets and experiment with different featurizer/split options and see what happens!
