title: ML01. Linear Regression Model Project in Python for Beginners Part 1
description: The English Premier League is one of the world's most-watched soccer leagues, with an estimated audience of 12 million people per game.
With the substantial financial benefits, all significant teams of EPL are interested in Analytics and AI. Regarding sports analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have become extremely popular. The sports entertainment sector and the relevant stakeholders extensively use sophisticated algorithms to improve earnings and reduce business risk associated with selecting or betting on the wrong players.

Regression is one of the foundational techniques in Machine Learning. As one of the most well-understood algorithms, linear regression plays a vital role in solving real-life problems.
In this project, we wish to use Linear Regression to predict the scores of EPL soccer players.
With the business implications cleared. Let's get into the project's technical details.

This project is part of the Linear Regression Beginner Project Series, and it consists of discussing and implementing the fundamentals of Linear Regression in Python on the EPL Soccer Player Dataset.
The second part of the series is [Linear Regression Model Project in Python for Beginners Part 2](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/multiple-linear-regression-project-for-beginners).

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
