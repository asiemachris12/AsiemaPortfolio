1.0 Configure your Azure ML workspace
---

## **1.1 Workspace parameters**

- To use an AML Workspace, you will need to import the Azure ML SDK and supply the following information:
  - Your subscription id

  - A resource group name

  - (optional) The region that will host your workspace

  - A name for your workspace

- You can get your subscription ID from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

- You will also need access to a [_resource group_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups), which organizes Azure resources and provides a default region for the resources in a group.  You can see what resource groups to which you have access, or create a new one in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  If you don't have a resource group, the create workspace command will create one for you using the name you provide.

- The region to host your workspace will be used if you are creating a new workspace.  You do not need to specify this if you are using an existing workspace. You can find the list of supported regions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=machine-learning-service).  You should pick a region that is close to your location or that contains your data.

- The name for your workspace is unique within the subscription and should be descriptive enough to discern among other AML Workspaces.  The subscription may be used only by you, or it may be used by your department or your entire enterprise, so choose a name that makes sense for your situation.

- The following cell allows you to specify your workspace parameters.  This cell uses the python method `os.getenv` to read values from environment variables which is useful for automation.  If no environment variable exists, the parameters will be set to the specified default values.  

- If you ran the Azure Machine Learning [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/quickstart-get-started) in Azure Notebooks, you already have a configured workspace!  You can go to your Azure Machine Learning Getting Started library, view *config.json* file, and copy-paste the values for subscription ID, resource group and workspace name below.

Replace the default values in the cell below with your workspace parameters

---

## **1.2 Access your workspace**

- The following cell uses the Azure ML SDK to attempt to load the workspace specified by your parameters.  If this cell succeeds, your notebook library will be configured to access the workspace from all notebooks using the `Workspace.from_config()` method.  The cell can fail if the specified workspace doesn't exist or you don't have permissions to access it.

---

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace

try:
    ws = Workspace(subscription_id = subscription_id, resource_group = resource_group, workspace_name = workspace_name)
    # write the details of the workspace to a configuration file to the notebook library
    ws.write_config()
    print("Workspace configuration succeeded. Skip the workspace creation steps below")
except:
    print("Workspace not accessible. Change your parameters or create a new workspace below")
```

---

### **1.2.1 Create a new workspace**

- If you don't have an existing workspace and are the owner of the subscription or resource group, you can create a new workspace.  If you don't have a resource group, the create workspace command will create one for you using the name you provide.

**Note**: As with other Azure services, there are limits on certain resources (for example AmlCompute quota) associated with the Azure ML service. Please read [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-manage-quotas) on the default limits and how to request more quota.

- This cell will create an Azure ML workspace for you in a subscription provided you have the correct permissions.

This will fail if:
* You do not have permission to create a workspace in the resource group

* You do not have permission to create a resource group if it's non-existing.

* You are not a subscription owner or contributor and no Azure ML workspaces have ever been created in this subscription

If workspace creation fails, please work with your IT admin to provide you with the appropriate permissions or to provision the required resources.

**Note**: A Basic workspace is created by default. If you would like to create an Enterprise workspace, please specify sku = 'enterprise'.
Please visit our [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/machine-learning/) for more details on our Enterprise edition.

---

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace

# Create the workspace using the specified parameters
ws = Workspace.create(name = "WS004_Regression_Splines",
                    subscription_id = "88187483-a72c-4f6a-83e5-43f1855302e1",
                    resource_group = "RG004-Regression_Splines", 
                    location = "South Africa North",
                    create_resource_group = True,
                    sku = 'basic',
                    exist_ok = True)
ws.get_details()

# write the details of the workspace to a configuration file to the notebook library
ws.write_config()
```

---

### **1.2.2 Create compute resources for your training experiments**

- Many of the sample notebooks use Azure ML managed compute (AmlCompute) to train models using a dynamically scalable pool of compute. In this section you will create default compute clusters for use by the other notebooks and any other operations you choose.

> Note that if you have an AzureML Data Scientist role, you will not have permission to create compute resources. Talk to your workspace or IT admin to create the compute targets described in this section, if they do not already exist.

- To create a cluster, you need to specify a compute configuration that specifies the type of machine to be used and the scalability behaviors.  Then you choose a name for the cluster that is unique within the workspace that can be used to address the cluster later.

The cluster parameters are:

- vm_size - this describes the virtual machine type and size used in the cluster.  All machines in the cluster are the same type.  You can get the list of vm sizes available in your region by using the CLI command

```shell
az vm list-skus -o tsv
```

- min_nodes - this sets the minimum size of the cluster.  If you set the minimum to 0 the cluster will shut down all nodes while not in use.  Setting this number to a value higher than 0 will allow for faster start-up times, but you will also be billed when the cluster is not in use.

- max_nodes - this sets the maximum size of the cluster.  Setting this to a larger number allows for more concurrency and a greater distributed processing of scale-out jobs.

- To create a **CPU** cluster now, run the cell below. The autoscale settings mean that the cluster will scale down to 0 nodes when inactive and up to 4 nodes when busy.

---

```python
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException

# Choose a name for your CPU cluster
cpu_cluster_name = "cpu-cluster"

# Verify that cluster does not exist already
try:
    cpu_cluster = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=cpu_cluster_name)
    print("Found existing cpu-cluster")
except ComputeTargetException:
    print("Creating new cpu-cluster")
    
    # Specify the configuration for the new cluster
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size="STANDARD_D2_V2",
                                                        min_nodes=0,
                                                        max_nodes=4)

    # Create the cluster with the specified name and configuration
    cpu_cluster = ComputeTarget.create(ws, cpu_cluster_name, compute_config)
    
    # Wait for the cluster to complete, show the output log
    cpu_cluster.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

#### **1. Dataset Overview**
Size: 19,158 rows and 14 columns.

Data Types:

**Numerical:** 4 columns (enrollee_id, city_development_index, training_hours, target).

**Categorical:** 10 columns (city, gender, relevant_experience, enrolled_university, education_level, major_discipline, experience, company_size, company_type, last_new_job).

**Critique:**
The dataset is relatively large (19,158 rows), which is good for building robust models.

The mix of numerical and categorical columns suggests that feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables) will be necessary for modeling.

**High Missing Values in Key Columns**

- Columns like company_size (5,938 missing) and company_type (6,140 missing) have a significant number of missing values. This could indicate that many candidates did not provide this information, or the data collection process was incomplete. These columns may not be useful for analysis unless imputation strategies are applied. However, imputing such a large proportion of missing values could introduce bias.

**Moderate Missing Values**

- Columns like gender (4,508 missing), major_discipline (2,813 missing), and last_new_job (423 missing) have moderate missing values. These columns can still be useful if the missing values are handled properly (e.g., imputation or removal).

**Low Missing Values**

- Columns like enrolled_university (386 missing), education_level (460 missing), and experience (65 missing) have relatively low missing values. These columns can be imputed or rows with missing values can be dropped without significantly affecting the dataset size.

## Step 2: Univariate Analysis

#### 2.1 Numerical Variables

- **Histograms**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Select numerical columns (excluding non-relevant columns like 'enrollee_id')
numerical_columns = [col for col in df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns if col != 'enrollee_id']

# Loop through numerical columns and plot distributions
for col in numerical_columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.histplot(df[col].dropna(), kde=True, bins=30)  # Drop missing values and customize bins
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {col}')
    plt.xlabel(col)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.savefig(f'{col}_distribution.png')  # Save the plot
    plt.show()
```

**Key Observations:**
The distribution appears to be unimodal (single peak), indicating that most of the data points are concentrated around a specific range of city_development_index. The peak of the distribution is likely around the middle of the range (e.g., 0.7 to 0.8), suggesting that this is the most common value for city_development_index in the dataset.

**Key Observations:**
The distribution appears to be bimodal (two peaks), indicating that the data points are concentrated around two specific values of the target variable. The peaks are likely around 0.0 and 1.0, suggesting that the target variable is binary or categorical with two distinct classes.

**Boxplots** (to detect outliers):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Select numerical columns (excluding non-relevant columns like 'enrollee_id')
excluded_numerical_columns = ['enrollee_id', 'target']
numerical_columns = [col for col in df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns if col != 'enrollee_id' ]

# Loop through numerical columns and plot boxplots
for col in numerical_columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.boxplot(x=df[col].dropna(), whis=1.5)  # Drop missing values and customize whiskers
    plt.title(f'Boxplot of {col}')
    plt.xlabel(col)
    plt.ylabel('Values')
    plt.savefig(f'{col}_boxplot.png')  # Save the plot

#### **4.2 Interaction Between Categorical Variables**

- **Grouped analysis:**

```python
for col1 in categorical_columns:
    for col2 in categorical_columns:
        if col1 != col2:
            print(f"Interaction between {col1} and {col2}:")
            print(df.groupby([col1, col2]).size().unstack())
```

---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/w24.png" title="Distribution of company type" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The x-axis represents the target variable, which likely ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the description. The y-axis represents the frequency or density of observations.
</div>

---

## Step 5: Handle Missing Values

**5.1 Identify columns with missing values:**

```python
for col1 in categorical_columns:
    for col2 in categorical_columns:
        if col1 != col2:
            print(f"Interaction between {col1} and {col2}:")
            print(df.groupby([col1, col2]).size().unstack())
```

---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/w25.png" title="Distribution of company type" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The x-axis represents the target variable, which likely ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the description. The y-axis represents the frequency or density of observations.
</div>

---

**5.2 Decide on a strategy:**

- Drop rows/columns with too many missing values.

- Impute missing values (e.g., mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical).

**5.3 Impute missing values:**

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# For numerical columns
num_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
df[numerical_columns] = num_imputer.fit_transform(df[numerical_columns])

# For categorical columns
cat_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')
df[categorical_columns] = cat_imputer.fit_transform(df[categorical_columns])
```

---

```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/w26.png" title="Distribution of company type" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The x-axis represents the target variable, which likely ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the description. The y-axis represents the frequency or density of observations.
</div>

---

## Step 6: Feature Engineering

**6.1 Create new features:**

- Example: Create a feature for total experience (total_experience = training_hours + years_in_current_company).

**6.2 Encode categorical variables:**

```python
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=categorical_columns, drop_first=True)
```

---

**6.3 Standardize numerical variables:**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
df_encoded[numerical_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(df_encoded[numerical_columns])
```

---

## Step 7: Save the Cleaned Dataset

- Save the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for modeling:

```python
df_encoded.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```
